      "Next.js is a popular React framework for building web applications. It is trusted by some of the biggest names on the web, including Nike, Audible, and The Washington Post, and is known for its performance, efficiency, and developer experience. Next.js is a production-grade tool that includes a number of built-in optimizations, such as automatic image, font, and script optimizations for improved user experience and Core Web Vitals. It also includes features like dynamic HTML streaming, advanced routing and nested layouts, and support for CSS and data fetching.\n" +
      "One of the key features of Next.js is its support for both server and client data fetching. This allows you to make your React components async and await your data, giving you the flexibility to fetch data on the server or the client. Next.js also includes support for server actions, which allow you to run server code by calling a function and then easily revalidate cached data and update your UI in one network roundtrip.\n" +
      "Next.js also includes a number of other features, such as support for client and server rendering, including incremental static regeneration (ISR), and the ability to style your application with your favorite tools, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and popular community libraries. It also includes support for route handlers, which allow you to build custom server-side logic for handling routes.\n" +
      "In addition to these features, Next.js is built on a foundation of fast, production-grade tooling, including React, the library for web and native user interfaces, and Turbopack, an incremental bundler optimized for JavaScript and TypeScript, written in Rust. It is also tightly integrated with Vercel, a frontend cloud from the creators of Next.js, making it easy to deploy and host your Next.js applications.\n" +
      "Overall, Next.js is a powerful and flexible framework for building modern web applications. It includes a wide range of features and optimizations out of the box, and is backed by a strong community and a team of dedicated developers.",
